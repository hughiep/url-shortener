- **Indexing**
Most database use B-tree by default. Complexity is O(log n) for search, insert, and delete.
Hash indexing is O(1) for search, insert, and delete. But it is not good for range queries. And not every database supports hash indexing.
Primary key is unique and not null. It is used to identify a row in a table. It is indexed by default. In shortern problem, the primary key could be the short code.

- **Cache Strategies**
- **Redis counter**
- **Hash function**
A hashing algorithm, in the context of Computer Science, refers to a method used to convert data into a fixed-size string of characters.
Some commonly used hashing algorithms include Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) 1 and 2.
The transformation of a key to the corresponding value is done using a Hash Function

MD5: 128-bit hash value, 32 characters long
SHA-1: 160-bit hash value, 40 characters long
SHA-256: 256-bit hash value, 64 characters long
SHA-512: 512-bit hash value, 128 characters long

- **Distributed cache**
